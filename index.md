Alexis Gibson is a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of Isabella Rauch in the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Immunology. She received her Ph.D. in Cell and Molecular Biology at the University of Pennsylvania. During her graduate work in the lab of Boris Striepen, Alexis studied the intestinal parasite Cryptosporidium and how its epithelial host cell responds to infection. Her post-doctoral work focuses on innate pathogen recognition in intestinal epithelial cells through inflammasomes and the impact of extrusion and cell death in infection and chronic disease, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Dr. Alexis Gibson is the recipient of a Cancer Research Institute/Bristol Myers Squibb Postdoctoral Fellowship.
